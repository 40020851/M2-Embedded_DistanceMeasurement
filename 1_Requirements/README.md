# REQUIREMENTS
The main aim of our project is to measure distance using ultrasonic sensor , LCD Display and atmega328.
## Introduction
In this project, we are going to interface Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 with Atmega328 and LCD Display. The ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance. It acts as a Sonar. It sends an ultrasonic wave of a certain frequency that comes back after hitting the object and calculates the time traveled by it. This distance measurement system can be widely used as range meters and as proximity detectors in
industries. The hardware part of ultrasonic sensor is interfaced with atmega328.
## Research
- The Ultrasonic Sensor sends out a high-frequency sound pulse and then times how long it takes for the echo of the sound to reflect back. The sensor has 2 openings on its front. One opening transmits ultrasonic waves, (like a tiny speaker), the other receives them, (like a tiny microphone).

- The speed of sound is approximately 341 meters (1100 feet) per second in air. The ultrasonic sensor uses this information along with the time difference between sending and receiving the sound pulse to determine the distance to an object.
## Features
- Highly accurate – Because of the way they work, Ultrasonic sensors are highly accurate and can be used to detect very small alterations in position. They can also measure the thickness of an object as well as the depth of the parallel surface.
- Detect a range of materials – Ultrasonic position sensors can detect and measure objects irrespective of their surface.
- ultrasonic sensors is that they can easily interface with a microcontroller and they are not dangerous to operate.
- Ultrasonic sensors generate high frequency sound waves and evaluate the echo which is received back by the sensor.
- Sensors calculate the time interval between sending the signal and receiving the echo to determine the distance to an object. The microcontroller is used to generate 40 kHz sound pulse.

# M2-Embedded_DistanceMeasurement

In this project, we are going to interface Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 with Atmega328 and LCD Display. The ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance. It sends an ultrasonic wave of a certain frequency that comes back after hitting the object and calculates the time traveled by it. This distance measurement system can be widely used as range meters and as proximity detectors in industries. The hardware part of ultrasonic sensor is interfaced with atmega328.
